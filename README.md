# kmeans
A Kmeans algorithm created for Alpaca Japan. All functions used are in the file kmeans_functions.py, while two test cases are in the file kmeans.py.

## With 4 normally distributed point distributions randomly generated.
- After initializing 4 normal distributions with 4 randomly generated cluster centres, this was the output result. Needing only 3 iterations.

)

## With a random number generator.
- Using a random number generator for both generating the point distribution and cluster centres. This one converged after 6 iterations.
